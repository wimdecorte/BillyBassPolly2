Driving Billy Bass motors from a Raspberry PI, using Windows 10 IoT and .NET

This was part of my FileMaker Devcon 2018 preparation in trying to drive the Billy Bass motors from .NET.  I got blocked by this issue: https://github.com/adafruit/AdafruitClassLibrary/issues/6
See the Wiki page for a screenshot of the FileMaker side of this demo (where the motor settings are read from).
